# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## 🧾 Program

Add code here
import math

class cse:
    def mech(self, r):
        area = math.pi * r * r
        print(area)

r = float(input())

obj = cse()
obj.mech(r)
## Output
Input:

5

Output:

78.53981633974483
## Result
Thus, the Python program to calculate the area of a circle using a class and object was executed successfully.
